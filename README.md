# Welcome to PyQuiz!!

To play it is very simple!!! Simply install the requirements in requirements.txt and then run main.py! It's that simple! Super fun game for those little moments you wanna be entertained and don't really know what to do or simple play against your friends!

You may use virtualenv to install dependencies seperately, keep it cleeean ;)

Any suggestions or ideas please let me know!
